# Case Study Proposal: How blockchain has revolutionized the Royal Bank of Canada to have an improved payments process


## What Is It

Blockchain promises to bring greater efficiency and transparency to the banking industry, for example, allowing cross-border transactions to be made in real-time and money to be exchanged at the speed with which information moves today.

RBC is experimenting with blockchain to help move payments between its U.S. / Canadian and other Geographies bank and commercial customers, with a due common set of standards and best practices.

Since 2017, the Royal Bank of Canada invested over $30 million CAD along with other Canadian banks into SecureKey’s blockchain identification system. SecureKey’s ID system will help Canadians verify their identities and credit information for banks, telecommunication firms, and government institutions, through mobile and desktop applications. The SecureKey ID project is based on IBM’s blockchain technology and built on the Hyperledger Fabric.

The technology was integrated into the bank's existing systems as a “shadow” to RBC’s primary ledger, letting the bank monitor payments in real-time as they travel between the United States and Canada or other geographies.


## Why This Matters

Global efforts to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism are incredibly expensive for financial firms to maintain. Back in 2014, it was estimated that global spending on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance alone amounted to $10 billion. The banks are coming under pressure from investors and analysts to reduce costs, but many expect the budgets for their compliance teams to increase in the coming years rather than decrease.

In addition to the financial burden, Know Your Customer (KYC) requests can also delay transactions, taking 30 to 50 days to complete to a satisfactory level. Current KYC processes also entail substantial duplication of effort between firms.
While annual compliance costs are high, there are also large penalties for failing to follow KYC guidelines properly. 

With the advent of fifth-generation telecommunications networks and the internet of things, blockchain is the term used to describe the growing number of devices and appliances connected to the internet and represent a combined transformational technology.


## Why This May be Interesting

The use of distributed ledger technology, or DLT, would improve the speed of payments, reduce complexity and lower costs. 

Although Blockchain emerged in 2009 as the system underpinning the cryptocurrency bitcoin, allowing people to exchange electronic currency quickly and anonymously. In 2017-2018 a shared ledger evolved in Canadian Banks for transactions maintained by a network of computers rather than a central authority. The online version of that ledger that’s instantly accessible by multiple parties – secure, accurate, and updated in real-time. It’s called blockchain and it’s bringing fast change to global trade and finance. Investors have since put billions of dollars into developing blockchain, betting the technology could make banking operations faster, more efficient, and more transparent.

A blockchain transaction could flow like this:
* A want to send money to B
* The transaction is represented online as a “block”, a coin, or a token in a database
* The block is broadcast to every party in the network
*Those in the network approve the transaction
* After validation, the block is added to the chain, which provides an indelible and transparent record of transactions
* The money moves from A to B.

In today's world, Blockchain is leading the Bank to do its original purpose of being set up to connect communities together and facilitate trade and commerce at a global scale which is secure and irrefutable. The more efficient global trade gets the more the community benefit. It is decentralized – no single person owns it. So, it is a fantastic collaborative tool.

RBC is looking to use blockchain to improve its rewards, loyalty offers, and trade finance capabilities.
